Curiosity, problem-solving, and storytelling have been at the core of my journeyâ€”from working behind the scenes in film productions to decoding the patterns hidden in data. My transition into data science wasnâ€™t just a career shift; it was a natural evolution of my passion for uncovering insights and crafting narratives that drive action.

As a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer, I specialize in Python, machine learning modeling (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and data visualization. Whether it's predicting natural disasters with logistic regression and LSTMs, building movie recommendation engines using K-Nearest Neighbors, or integrating machine learning models into interactive applications, I thrive in turning raw data into actionable insights.

What I Bring to the Table:
Machine Learning & AI â€“ Hands-on experience developing models for predictive analytics, recommendation systems, and time-series forecasting.
Data Wrangling & Engineering â€“ Skilled in Pandas, NumPy, SQL, and working with large, complex datasets to extract meaningful insights.
End-to-End Model Deployment â€“ Experience with API integrations, model serialization (pickle, joblib), and visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, interactive dashboards).
Storytelling with Data â€“ Translating complex findings into compelling narratives that inform decision-making and strategy.

My Unique Edge?
Coming from an industry where adaptability, teamwork, and fast-paced problem-solving are essential, I bring a creative mindset, strong communication skills, and the ability to break down technical concepts for diverse audiences. I know how to balance analytical rigor with storytelling, ensuring data-driven insights donâ€™t just sit in reportsâ€”they drive action.

Iâ€™m always eager to connect with like-minded professionals, collaborate on exciting projects, and explore how machine learning can solve real-world problems. If youâ€™re looking for a data-driven thinker with a unique background and a relentless curiosity, letâ€™s connect!
